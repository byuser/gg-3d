# Task 7 — Russian language support (selectable at start + in pause settings)

> Part of the [Good Game 3D backlog](../TODO.md). Shared rules + Definition of Done live there.
- **Status:** `[x]` — 2026-06-21 · Shipped full **English + Russian** localization: an i18n layer
  (`LOCALES = { en, ru }` + `t(key, params)` with interpolation/plurals, persisted in
  `localStorage`) drives all UI/dynamic strings, while the data tables keep English as the source
  and a parallel `RU` object supplies Russian via per-field resolvers. Retrofitted **every**
  user-facing string (start screen, HUD, toasts, prompts, all overlays + every data table). Added
  EN/RU language selectors on the start screen + pause settings (live re-render, `<html lang>`),
  and a new harness suite [28] (key-parity, interpolation, pluralization, data completeness,
  locale persistence) plus a feature smoke check.
- **Depends on:** none. **Recommended FIRST** so later tasks add bilingual
  strings as they go (see Golden Rule 9).
- **Goal.** Full **English + Russian** localization, switchable from the **start
  screen** and the **pause → settings**, applied live and persisted.
- **Scope (build this):**
  - An **i18n layer**: `LOCALES = { en, ru }` dictionaries + a `t(key, params)`
    function (with interpolation + simple pluralization where needed) + the
    current‑locale state persisted in `localStorage`.
  - **Retrofit every user‑facing string** through `t()`: static `index.html`
    text (start screen, controls, overlays, buttons), dynamic JS toasts/labels/
    prompts, and **data‑table** strings — zone names, NPC names + dialogue,
    quest titles/stories, item names/descriptions, weather/clock labels, etc.
    (Prefer keys/ids in data tables, with display names resolved via `t()`.)
  - A **language selector** on the start screen and in pause settings; switching
    **re‑renders** all visible UI immediately (no reload needed) and updates the
    `<html lang>`.
  - Complete, natural **Russian** translations for everything (not machine‑literal
    placeholders); keep the layout intact for longer strings.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - Toggling EN⇄RU updates **100% of visible text** live; no English leaks in RU
    mode (and vice‑versa). Verify there are **no missing keys** in either locale.
  - The choice **persists** across reload and applies before first paint.
  - Headless‑safe (`localStorage`/DOM feature‑detected); harness stays green.
- **Tests to add:** **key‑parity test** (every key in `en` exists in `ru` and
  vice‑versa); `t()` interpolation/pluralization; locale persistence round‑trip;
  a sampling of data‑table names resolve in both locales.
- **Files:** `js/game.js` (new `I18N`/`Locale`, retrofit all strings, settings +
  persistence), `index.html` (string ids / data‑i18n hooks + selector markup),
  `css` (selector + settings), `test/harness.js`, `README.md`.
- **Hints:** centralize the dictionary; give every UI element a stable key;
  resolve data‑table display names through `t()` so future content stays
  translatable. Add a lint‑style test that **fails on any untranslated key**.
